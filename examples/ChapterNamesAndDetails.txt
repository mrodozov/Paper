1. Noise tool 
- Overview 
- Counts, Rates, Rates/cm^2 
- Strips conditions, algorithms 
- Detailed run rate (per time interval) 
- Web site, DB data and WBM - with reference to LB -> Roll model 
- RE4 update 
  
  -- second part -- 
  
- noise tool and webpage details 
- chain of analysis (noise data chain)
- custom scripts for drawing plots
- other stuff, future of noise page etc. 

2. LinkBoard to Rolls model 
- chambers modeling 
- mapping strip to channel numbers
- application in DB data translation
- application in BK studies - online and offline
- application in threshold callibration task - chip class and chips object
- application in RE4 upgrade with the 

3. Background studies with the noise tool
- Linear correlation with the luminosity
- Studies per chamber and per roll
- Rate distribution along the detector - longitudinal, azimuthal, RPC2012
- Luminometer idea, bad correlated plots from 2012
- FLUKA measurements

4. Threshold calibration study
- threshold vs chip average rate plots
- desirable rate values 

5. RE4 Upgrade 
- little bit about bakelite difference (read some paper)
- little bit about chamber 
- Cosmic stands 
- data unification
- event base model and Converter class
- Cosmic stand class, config class, run details class and chamber class model 
- analysis on efficiency cls etc
- results from the analysis and differences with respect the old chambers
- conclusions on analysis
- chamber construction examples on few pages

6. Other service stuff 

7. Tprime participation 

- expaining the model 
- experiment set and results 

8. Conclusions
